## Input:
The MovieList.js file hard-coded a list of Movie objects with key-value pairs of title, genre, and release year as a JavaScript list. The user could interact with a dropdown menu to filter all movies to show only a specific genre.

## Process:
On startup of the application, the browser populates the screen with the title, a dropdown list of available genres, and a list of all movies. After a user selects a specific genre, the page updates and displays only the movies that match the chosen genre. If a user clicks on a single movie tile, it will display an alert pop-up with the movie title in that alert.

## Output:
The output is solely displayed in the user's browser and initially displays a complete list of all movies. This list can dynamically change in the DOM if the user selects a specific genre, which will change the display to only show movies that match that genre. If the user chooses to click on a specific movie, an alert pop-up will display the title of the movie.

This assignment shows how inputs can be displayed and transformed into outputs through a defined process.
